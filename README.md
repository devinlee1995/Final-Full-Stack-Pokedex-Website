# Final-Full-Stack-Pokedex-Website

For now, this code solely works on a local machine. The code can still be viewed. In order to run the app on your own console,
a heroku link will be added soon in the near future.

For this website, you can search for Pokemon by entering a name on the main page. 
In order for you to make a team, you first need to make an account. After making an account by inputting a username and password,
you can log in on the bottom. A successful login will allow you to access a team page, where you can add Pokemon to your team.
Only 6 can be added. The 6 you choose are all stored in a database and can be viewed again by logging in.
